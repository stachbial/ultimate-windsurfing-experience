# ultimate-windsurfing-experience
This is the first project I have ever made, that basically started my adventure with programming.
A 2d game written in c++ using SFML library, which was my final project on programming classes.
I have never developed it further since I had submitted it at uni.
There are lots of possible fixes or refactoring ideas, but I chose to continue on learning by making new projects.
For now I have no plans on changing it, as it has quite sentimental value for me:)

This repository does not contain any project configuration files - only the raw files i have written myself back in 2020.
The music and textures are made by very talented collegues of mine.
